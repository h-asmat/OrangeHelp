# OrangeHelp


Get emergency help from people around you. On new planet, we want people around us to help each in case of emergencies. Idea behind this program/system is to use everyone's skills on new planet carefully so that need of special forces like police, doctors, and fire dept can be minimized. Some situations:


•    In case of strokes/minor burns we want people around us with first aid skills to help. Hospitals should be used for some serious issues only.

•    In case of small fire, people with rescuing skills around us should be called.

•    In case of violence/fights people with conflict resolution skills should be alerted.

### Assumptions


•    Sensors/Microphones are installed at common areas

•    Everyone has the android app installed and they know the 3 magic words

•    Our database has everyone’s skills (we got it when they boarded the spaceship :p)


### Instructions


•    If you need help just shout 1 of the 3 magic words and the sensors will
       detect the word
       
•    People with skills related to the accident will get an alert on their app

•    Map will provide location of accident and your current location
